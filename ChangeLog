	* Demon and devil levels are now shuffled, so Asmodeus' Lair may
	  appear before Demogorgon's Lair.
	* Applied Randomized Sokoban Prize patch, with a chance of generating
	  cloak of magic resistance.
	* Players can select Sokoban prize like UnNetHack by enabling 
	  CHOOSABLE_SOKOPRIZE in config.h.
	* Ettins and their undead counterparts, as well as titans, now have
	  their M2_GIANT flag set.
	* Flame/ice mage quest artifacts and first sacrifice gift are changed
	  by enabling ENHANCED_MAGE_ARTI in config.h.
	  	- Firewall Deep Freeze now summons fire/water elementals.
		  Earth/air elementals are summoned when invoked while
		  confused.
		- The Candle of Eternal Flame now confers hungerless
		  regeneration, teleport control, cold resistance, and a
		  passive 1d10 fire attack when carried.
		- The Storm Whistle now confers energy regeneration, teleport
		  control, fire resistance, and a passive 1d10 cold attack
		  when carried.
	* Applied Enhanced Artifacts patch, with some differences:
		- Giantkiller is an axe which warns the player of giants while
		  wielded, deals an extra 20 damage, gives a +8 bonus to hit, 
		  and has a small chance of instakilling at most 7 adjacent 
		  giants (including titans and ettins).
		- Dragonbane is a dwarvish spear which deals double damage and
		  provides a +8 to-hit bonus against dragons. It also grants
		  reflection while wielded.
		- Sunsword is a long sword which detects and deals double
		  damage against undead, has a chance of blinding any
		  opponent, and prevents light-based blinding.
		- Demonbane is now a silver long sword which deals double
		  damage and gives a +8 to-hit bonus against major demons, and
		  prevents demon-gating.
		- Trollsbane grants hungerless regeneration while wielded, and
		  has a +20 to-damage and +8 to-hit bonus against trolls.
		- Ogresmasher provides a bonus +8 to-hit and +20 to-damage,
		  and sets constitution to a constant 25 when carried.
		- Sword of Balance now deals double damage and gives +5 to-hit
		  against cross-aligned enemies.
		- Vorpal Blade gives a +8 bonus to-damage.
		- Added a new artifact called Mouser's Scalpel, and
		  uncommented the relevant code in artifact.c. It's a rapier
		  which gives +5 to-hit bonus and +1 to-damage. Since rapiers
		  are not randomly generated, one can only find a naturally
		  generated Mouser's Scalpel in Grund's Stronghold.
		- Grimtooth is a permanently poisoned weapon, much like
		  Serpent's Tongue.
		- Deathsword occasionally knocks the opponents unconscious.
		- Elfrist detects elves.

		  invoking an alignment quest artifact induce a penalty to
		  alignment and luck.
		- The Heart of Ahriman confers stealth, displacement and
		  energy regeneration when carried.
		- The Sceptre of Might again deals double damage against
		  cross-aligned monsters. It also sets the wielder's strength

		  unaligned crystal ball which tame nearby creatures when
		  invoked.

	  sink could also convert it into a toilet.
	* Applied Flipped Levels patch by Pasi Kallinen.

	* Applied Watchmen Bribery patch by L.
	* Vlad the Impaler and Doctor Frankenstein are tougher.
	* Floating eyes are now bright green in TTY.

	  longer guaranteed iron boots any more.
	* Pistols, bullets, silver bullets and frag grenades may randomly
	  generate if FIREARM_RANDGEN is enabled.
	* The times a long worm attack per move is equal to the length of the

	SporkHack)
	* Drain energy attack against player is implemented and works as if
	stepping on an anti-magic field.

	* Empty wands may crumble after an unsuccessful wresting.
	* Green slimes' passive sliming attack is implemented. Hitting while
	bare-handed starts the sliming process.

	epitaphs.
	* Flame mage quest artifact can destroy potions/scrolls/spellbooks
	through passive fire attack. Similarly, ice mage quest artifact can

	readable.
	* Player-vampires gain intrinsic sleep resistance and poison
	resistance at level 7 if EASIER_VAMPIRE is enabled.
		- Still needs further testing to balance...

	player to wrest a wand in zero turns.

2014-03-24	SLASH'EM UP	0.0.1E3
	* Strong monster wielding two-handed weapon can shatter the opponent's
	wielding weapon just like the player.
	* Artifacts have a chance of shattering. Be careful.
	* The possibility of defender's weapon shattering relates to BUC
	status, enchantment, erosion, and whether it is an artifact. Erosion
	of the attacker's weapon also counts.
	* Partially applied L's resistance patch.
		- Resistances granted from eating and leveling up are now half
		resistances, which reduces the damage or effect by half.
		- Extrinsic resistances and starting intrinsic resistances are
		full resistances.
		- Magic resistance (currently) remains unchanged.
		- Fire damage (currently) does not reduce maximum HP.
		- Elves and drow have full sleep resistance.
		- Vampires have full sleep and poison resistance.
	* Flame/ice mage quest and quest nemeses is slightly redesigned.
		- Flame mages will encounter a lot of water-based and
		ice-based monsters, including sea monsters, water trolls,
		frost giants, water nymphs, water demons etc.
		- Ice mages will fight through various fiery monsters and
		demons in their quest. Beware of demon summoning.
		- The quest nemesis for flame mages is Neptulon, the water
		elemental lord in World of Warcraft. He has two arcane
		spell-casting attacks, and can deal a fair amount of physical
		damage, as well as possessing a passive cold attack.
		- Quest nemesis for ice mages is Ragnaros the Firelord, also
		from World of Warcraft. He is merely a fiery counterpart of
		Neptulon. He can cast both arcane and clerical spells, and
		deals a lot of fire and physical damage.
	* Price identification is no longer available to certain object types:
		- All rings.
		- All wands.
		- All potions.
		- All spellbooks.
		- All scrolls.
		- Armors with randomized appearance. Specifically, all magic
		cloaks, all robes, all conical hats, helmets and magic helms,
		all gloves, and all magic boots.

		magical counterparts, both wooden and magic harps, leather
		drum and drum of earthquake.

	displacement.
	* Game will pause when a secret door or passage is revealed. ("You find
	a secret door" or "You reveal a secret passage")
	* Applied Randomized Planes patch by Patric Mueller.
	* Specifying "dragon scales" or "dragon scale mail" in level
	description file generates random dragon scales/scale mail, instead of
	printing a warning message, if RANDOM_DRAGON_SCALES is enabled.
	* Up to three random dragon scales can generate at the arch-lich
	statue trap in Lawful Quest if RANDOM_DRAGON_SCALES is enabled.
		- If RANDOM_DRAGON_SCALES is disabled, random objects are
		created instead.
	* Inspired by Color Alchemy patch, the product of mixing two potions
	other than blood or vampire blood is no longer random if the player is
	a healer or wearing a lab coat.
		- Mixing with a potion of amnesia always produces an undiluted
		potion of amnesia.
		- Mixing with potion of blood or vampire blood still produces
		random results.
	* Plague is associated with drovenkind.
	* Excalibur can randomly generate, can be obtained by sacrificing, and
	could not be obtained by dipping unless you are a knight.
	* Applied Statuscolors patch.
		- BUG: Status colors are not displayed before you press a key.
		- NOTE: This patch is not recommended for slow computer users,
		as the bottom line would flash _a lot_.
	* 'c's "tastes like chicken" (cockatrice if hallucinating).
	* Vlad the Impaler has his own hallucinatory names (thanks to those
	Dudley's Dungeon guys).
	* Protection for monks not wearing body armor other than robes are
	(level / 3) + 1
	* Cavemen have a 1 in 10 chance of reading scrolls as if they are
	confused.

	* Sea monsters CAN BE RANDOMLY GENERATED.
	* Introduced and slightly modified Heck^2 levels. Gehennom is longer.
	* Monsters killed by Trollsbane won't revive (except riders, of
	course).
	* Bug fixed: overviewing the level containing spellbook shops and
	black market only displays "a shop".
		- SLASH'EM added some shop types, so 5 bit is not enough.
	* Bug fixed:
		- C343-1:   At a pit the game can give messages with poor
		grammar. 
		- C343-23:  Dungeon collapses after vault guard fails to lead
		you out.
		- C343-77:  Some messages referring to monsters that look like
		horses refer to claws.
		- C343-263: Probing may miss Schroedinger's cat.
