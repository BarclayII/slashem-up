	* Demon and devil levels are now shuffled, so Asmodeus' Lair may
	  appear before Demogorgon's Lair.
	* The gray dragon scales at the arch-lich statue trap now only have
	  50% chance of being generated. Silver and deep dragon scales may be
	  generated there as well.
	* Applied Randomized Sokoban Prize patch, with a chance of generating
	  cloak of magic resistance.
	* Players can select Sokoban prize like UnNetHack by enabling 
	  CHOOSABLE_SOKOPRIZE in config.h.
	* Ettins and their undead counterparts, as well as titans, now have
	  their M2_GIANT flag set.
	* Flame/ice mage quest artifacts and first sacrifice gift are changed
	  by enabling ENHANCED_MAGE_ARTI in config.h.
	  	- Firewall Deep Freeze now summons fire/water elementals.
		  Earth/air elementals are summoned when invoked while
		  confused.
		- The Candle of Eternal Flame now confers hungerless
		  regeneration, teleport control, cold resistance, and a
		  passive 1d10 fire attack when carried.
		- The Storm Whistle now confers energy regeneration, teleport
		  control, fire resistance, and a passive 1d10 cold attack
		  when carried.
	* Applied Enhanced Artifacts patch, with some differences:
		- Giantkiller is an axe which warns the player of giants while
		  wielded, deals an extra 20 damage, gives a +8 bonus to hit, 
		  and has a small chance of instakilling at most 7 adjacent 
		  giants (including titans and ettins).
		- Dragonbane is a dwarvish spear which deals double damage and
		  provides a +8 to-hit bonus against dragons. It also grants
		  reflection while wielded.
		- Sunsword is a long sword which detects and deals double
		  damage against undead, has a chance of blinding any
		  opponent, and prevents light-based blinding.
		- Demonbane is now a silver long sword which deals double
		  damage and gives a +8 to-hit bonus against major demons, and
		  prevents demon-gating.
		- Trollsbane grants hungerless regeneration while wielded, and
		  has a +20 to-damage and +8 to-hit bonus against trolls.
		  Trolls killed by Trollsbane STILL MAY REVIVE.
		- Ogresmasher provides a bonus +8 to-hit and +20 to-damage,
		  and sets constitution to a constant 25 when carried.
		- Sword of Balance now deals double damage and gives +5 to-hit
		  against cross-aligned enemies.
		- Vorpal Blade gives a +8 bonus to-damage.
		- Added a new artifact called Mouser's Scalpel, and
		  uncommented the relevant code in artifact.c. It's a rapier
		  which gives +5 to-hit bonus and +1 to-damage. Since rapiers
		  are not randomly generated, one can only find a naturally
		  generated Mouser's Scalpel in Grund's Stronghold.
		- Grimtooth is a permanently poisoned weapon, much like
		  Serpent's Tongue.
		- Deathsword now sometimes confuses enemy if hit.
		- Elfrist now detects elves.

		  energy regeneration when carried.
		- The Sceptre of Might again deals double damage against
		  cross-aligned monsters. It also sets the wielder's strength
		  at 18 + enchantment, to the maximum of 25.

		  unaligned crystal ball which tame nearby creatures when
		  invoked.
